ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
<External libraries, other hackers/teams, generative AI models (i.e. ChatGPT),
online resources, etc.>

We utilied the following tools to build our app:

- Tailwind Docs
- Figma

REFLECTION
<What motivated your team to choose this project?>
As freshmen, we know how hard it can be to break out of your comfort zone and 
find friends who truly click with you. We built JumBuddy to help fellow Jumbos 
easily discover events, connect over shared interests, and create lasting 
memories on campus!

<Potential future work/improvements?>
In the future, we would like to add a friend system with notifications and 
locations with a map, so you can see what your jumBuddy friends are up to around 
campus. E.g “John is in tisch, study with him!” if you were to enter tisch. 

<What is a challenge you encountered while making this?>
A challenge we encountered was connecting the frontend with the backend. Many times we
would be all be working on the code simultaneously using liveshare. If something was wrong
in either area, it would slow testing processes, which was difficult at times.

<What is a fun or interesting experience you had with another hacker?>
We locked ourselves in JCC 280 for the past two days, and had 'hype up sessions' to 
motivate ourselves and get our bodies moving. We would stretch and run around the
room while playing hype music.
